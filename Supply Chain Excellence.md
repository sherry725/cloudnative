Supply chain is a system of transformation and we take resources such as finances, material, labor and equipment and that's what creates the final product in the end.

How do we achieve efficiency? the lean Six Sigma methodology. How would you measure efficiency in your supply chain? Identify metrics that illustrate supply chain efficiency, like inventory turns, financial metrics, time.

Flexibility allows you to react to unanticipated levels of customer demand. How would you achieve flexibility? Well, the one thing is speed. You have to be quick in order to react fast enough. The other one is interchangeability. You need to be as efficient producing different types of products at different times. If you're producing one thing, changing over to another thing should be seamless and quick and easy. Then lastly, it also has to do with design. You have to manufacture products in different ways. For that, you have to develop them so they can be manufactured in different ways. So design plays a very big role in having that flexibility.

Resilient supply chain is one that can face risks, but they don't lead to disruptions. Two factors that are important when it comes to resilience, one is how likely are you to discover a disruption, and the other one is your ability to recover. One is, can you recognize disruptions very early, because if you recognize them early, you have time to avoid them. And the other one is, how good are you at recovering? How good are you at finding alternative ways to doing things until everything comes back to normal? Both of those factors are critical when it comes to building a resilient supply chain.

Generally, lean relies on two main principles, that's just in time, JIT or, and Jidoka, which is error proofing. Because a lean supply chain doesn't have a lot of inventory that just sits around and that just gives you buffers and you have to have a continuous flow of materials, you have to be able to take away any errors and uncertainty that you could possibly have. So, you have to be very careful when it comes to your processes because nothing can go wrong otherwise there's going to be a disruption.

We also have to have a standardized customer focus planning process, which is the Hoishin (Planning), looks far into the future and make sure that all of the plans are done in such a way that we can pull off this continuous flow pull system.

You also want stability. You want your processes to be as level as possible because in a manufacturing environment, you always want to avoid big changes because otherwise, one day you have your machines and your workers working really fast and then the other day they have nothing to do.

 The approach that lean takes, it's an efficiency way of thinking. But the approach is that you have one speed to the supply chain which matches the speed at which your customers come in. So, if your customers buy products more quickly, then you have to work more quickly. And if your customers are a little slower then you'll slow down the entire supply chain. And that speed mechanism is what's really important to lean.

 1. One of the seven wastes is overproduction. If you produce more than what your customers are willing to buy, obviously that' s waste. 2. Second one is inventory. If you believe that your supply chains should be truly just in time, then inventory should be kept to a minimum and inventory itself has no value until it's turned into the final product that a customer wants to buy. 3. Third one is motion. Moving products around just aimlessly back and forth without accomplishing more value or creating more value in the product itself is wasteful. You're not achieving anything by moving a product unless it serves a purpose. 4. Fourth one is defects. If you're building a product that has defects and you created something of inferior value, so what you created ultimately is considered a waste because now you either have to throw it out or somebody has to go back in and fix it. So any defect is considered a waste. 5. Related to that, becomes over-processing, because if you have a defect and you need to work on something a second time after you didn't do it right the first time. So over-processing means you have to do things over and over to get it just right. You ideally want to produce a perfect product from the beginning. 6. Waiting. Having a product just sit there without adding more value to it consistently is wasteful because you can sequence the task in such a way that there's no waiting. So if you can't accomplish that, then having a product just sitting there doing nothing has no value, so it's wasteful. 7. Then finally, transport. Moving products, unless it is to move it to the final customer is not adding any value to the product, it's wasteful. So these are the seven wastes that were originally identified by Toyota and then later on incorporated into Lean thinking.

 Jidoka means error proofing and the idea behind it is that you want to build your whole supply chain system in such a way that it is very difficult for individual workers to make mistakes.

 Agile supply chain: Fast, an agile supply chain can react to any changes very quickly. Flexible. So when you have an agile supply chain, you don't worry too much about, say, getting your forecast perfect right from the beginning. Because you have speed and flexibility to make sure that the changes in consumer demand on this one product, you react to it. Experimentation. You're willing to try new things out, see if they work. And if they do work, then they could become a major part of your company, and if they don't work, you move on to the next thing. So it's this very entrepreneurial approach to supply chain management, which is very different from both a Lean approach and sort of your traditional economies of scale. Because economies of scale, you try to have everything as fixed as possible, and in Lean you want to sort of move with the speed of customer, but you don't want to be changing things around constantly and chasing new trends and trying new things. So an agile supply chain typically is very popular in, for example, the fashion industry, where you have new trends, and you want to take advantage of those trends. And once a trend dies down, you shut this one part down and you move over to something completely different, and then you start up something new, and all the time you're just chasing trend after trend after trend. That's when an agile supply chain has to be implemented. So an agile supply chain doesn't really worry about establishing anything permanent, everything is up to change and you really want to focus on being able to keep up.

Implementing the agile supply chain - Speed:
Source                      Make                            Deliver
Faster sourcing             Faster manufacturing            Faster deliveries
Reduce wait time            Reduce wait time                Reduce wait time

Implementing the agile supply chain - Flexibility:
Teams - Short runs, Focus on speed, Cross training, Changeovers

Implementing the agile supply chain - Experimentation:
Strive for effciency (while accepting speed and flexibility)
- do more with less
- refine processes
Tolerate failure
- encourage process improvement
- reward creativity
Culture of innovation

Two important factors that a resilient supply chain really has: ability to resist disruptions from manifesting themselves, and it has the ability to recover more quickly. Disruption timeline: avoid -> contain -> stabilize -> return

Risks that could impact the company: procurement risk, manufacturing risk, logistic risk.
Procurement risk is typically focused around suppliers and what happens in their realm and there are things that might swap over to your organization. 1. natural disasters that could impact your suppliers, especially when you have areas that are clustered with certain types of suppliers. 2. political disruptions, and those could be through maybe a government gets overturned or there are change in policies and they impact how goods flow in and out of that country. 3. process risk. Something within the suppliers manufacturing process, we're broke and it didn't necessarily get fixed in time. 4. financial risk. The supplier is either going out of business or threatening to go out of business or there's some kind of a financial issue, and that happens occasionally and you as the customer then obviously are at risk because that supplier might not exist anymore and you have to find a way to deal with it. 
Mnufacturing risk and you see some of those same categories, your operations might be hit by some natural disaster or there's some political risk that affects your own operations or something in your process has gone wrong, maybe you didn't detect a quality issue that you might have had announced starts impacting the types of products you produce. 
So similar risks and similar risk also on the logistic side but now they affect your customer. So your deliveries might be slowed down to some natural event or political risk or it could be things like strikes. So sometimes dock workers are striking so no products get in and out of a certain port, or something in your own delivery process has gone wrong and you're not delivering the right products to the right customers. 

There are some trade-offs necessary when you think about being resilient and being efficient. When it comes to risk mitigation, there are certain things that you can do. 1. And most companies are going to have some kind of an insurance system in place that in the event of a disruption, there are certain types of insurance policy that compensate you financially. That part is fine, but that's only financial compensation and that's not going to cover everything, or the entire loss that you would experience in a disruption. 2. Next thing you can do is to have a flexible supply chain. So now you start seeing when we look at all of these different goals, flexibility can actually help you with risk mitigation. Because you're able to shift things around, work around, isolate certain parts of your business, work around them. You have people who can do multiple jobs, so they're able to help out, and you can overcome disruptions a lot easier when you have flexibility. 
3. Another thing that you could do is to have redundancy in place. So you have multiples of everything, so if one part breaks down, you have a back-up plan and you're able to start right back up. 4. And the fourth one is inventory. So if you have plenty of inventory even if your manufacturing shuts down or a supplier is down, you have plenty of inventory. That's only going to be a tiny blip in your overall output because you have inventory to carry you through. Now I realize inventory is one of those things that could be considered a waste, but when it comes to disruption it's one of those essential things that give you some time to recover and customers are still going to receive their product. And that gives you time. So you trade off time versus inventory when it comes to resilience. So there are things that you can do to mitigate.
