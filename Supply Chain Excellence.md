Supply chain is a system of transformation and we take resources such as finances, material, labor and equipment and that's what creates the final product in the end.
How do we achieve efficiency? the lean Six Sigma methodology. How would you measure efficiency in your supply chain? Identify metrics that illustrate supply chain efficiency, like inventory turns, financial metrics, time.
Flexibility allows you to react to unanticipated levels of customer demand. How would you achieve flexibility? Well, the one thing is speed. You have to be quick in order to react fast enough. The other one is interchangeability. You need to be as efficient producing different types of products at different times. If you're producing one thing, changing over to another thing should be seamless and quick and easy. Then lastly, it also has to do with design. You have to manufacture products in different ways. For that, you have to develop them so they can be manufactured in different ways. So design plays a very big role in having that flexibility.
Resilient supply chain is one that can face risks, but they don't lead to disruptions. Two factors that are important when it comes to resilience, one is how likely are you to discover a disruption, and the other one is your ability to recover. One is, can you recognize disruptions very early, because if you recognize them early, you have time to avoid them. And the other one is, how good are you at recovering? How good are you at finding alternative ways to doing things until everything comes back to normal? Both of those factors are critical when it comes to building a resilient supply chain.
Generally, lean relies on two main principles, that's just in time, JIT or, and Jidoka, which is error proofing. Because a lean supply chain doesn't have a lot of inventory that just sits around and that just gives you buffers and you have to have a continuous flow of materials, you have to be able to take away any errors and uncertainty that you could possibly have. So, you have to be very careful when it comes to your processes because nothing can go wrong otherwise there's going to be a disruption.
A standardization customer focus planning process, which is the Hoishin Planning, looks far into the future and make sure that all of the plans are done in such a way that we can pull off this continuous flow pull system.
