# Sample vs Population
* For studies it is optimal if the sample which provides the data is representative of the population under study. One way of getting a representative sample is something called simple random sampling. How might we study populations that can be considered to be marginalized in some situations, like intravenous drug users, or homeless persons, or men who have sex with men? Some strategies involve convenience sampling, sample from those who show up to a certain clinic or participate in a needle exchange who has stayed a homeless shelter. So they becoming more common, it's called respondent-driven sampling. So, we start with a few persons or subjects from the sample and ask them to recruit their colleagues and associates as well.
