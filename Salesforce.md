# Marketing Associates
* Inbound leads show interest through their online behavior.
Inbound leads come directly to a business and express their interest through behaviors like visiting the company’s website and downloading an eBook from them, subscribing to their blog, or signing up for more information. All of these activities provide the business with the lead's contact information. Note that a marketing team would typically handle the management of the company's website and the creation and distribution of marketing content like eBooks and blogs which are designed to attract inbound leads.
* Outbound leads express an interest only when directly contacted.
Outbound leads are those businesses seek out and approach in order to sell to them. This is often done through cold calling. Businesses can also buy “lead lists” which are lists of leads and their contact information sold by third parties. Note that both marketing and sales teams manage the generation of outbound leads. Later in this course, you will learn more about the sales team's role in generating outbound leads. 

# common sources of data that might use to qualify leads include: 
1 - Demographic information (e.g. where a lead is located)
2 - Company information (e.g. size of the company)
3 - Behavior online (e.g. number of times they have engaged with a website)

Salesforce helps businesses track and organize all information related to potential customers, existing customers, and in-progress sales deals, which all involves input from teams like marketing, sales, and support. This means that all of these different teams with all their different types of business users will want to track this information in Salesforce to ensure that everything is stored in one place. 

Some key reasons why you would want to ensure that marketing associates are importing their data into Salesforce are:
To get all the data in one place
To organize the data
To collaborate with other team members throughout the sales process, ensuring that the sales process is as efficient and effective as possible
