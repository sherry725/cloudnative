To identify the needs, 
1. people tell us stories about what they care about, what they are working on, and where they are getting stuck. 
2. detailed understanding of how some process happens.
A data science need is a problem that can be solved with knowledge, not a lack of a particular tool.
It is tremendously useful to acquire a good mental library of examples by reading widely and experimenting with new ideas. We can expand our library by talking to people about the problems theyâ€™ve solved, reading books on data science or reading classics (like Edward Tufte and Richard Feynman), following blogs, attending conferences and meetups, and experimenting with new
ideas all the time.
